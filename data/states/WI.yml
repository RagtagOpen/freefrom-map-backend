quote: ... A lot of transformative/restorative justice is still extremely centered on the abuser, so making sure these practices are truly supporting and centering the survivor and honoring their wants and needs. I also believe the financial burden of everything associated with the abuse should not fall on the survivor. Time off from work and even intervention systems such as community bringing hot foods and groceries to survivors would also take a big load off of or shoulders in order to focus on healing. And lastly, honoring rage that survivors have.
