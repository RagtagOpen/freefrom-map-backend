quote: ... I am [still financially healing]. I was in an abusive relationship with my husband. He was financially, emotionally, mentally, sexually and physical abusive towards me. He kept me inside the apartment and would not allow me to do anything. Now I am currently living in a shelter because I don't have any money because he didn't allow me to do so. I had some jewelry that I had and he kept that from me.
